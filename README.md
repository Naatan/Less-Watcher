This addon is extremely crafty, I am only sharing it cause I have no time to
package it properly atm.

Note that the actual addon name is "Komodo Utils", originally I had intended
it to be a collection of tools but I've changed my mind on that.

To use; edit content/less-watcher/<your-platform>/chrome.manifest and adjust the
paths to reflect your own.

Then edit content/less-watcher/chrome.manifest and edit/add the paths that you
want to be watched for changes.

Sometimes you need to change your Komodo skin back and forth for the watcher to
pick up changes, I've not yet figured out why.
